# Campus-Course-Records-Manager-CCRM-
This project is a comprehensive Java SE application for managing student records, courses, and grades. It demonstrates various core Java concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and design patterns, including the use of abstract classes, enums, the Builder pattern, and more.
Java Architecture: JDK, JRE, and JVM
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The core of the Java platform. It's an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. The JVM interprets and runs the .class files generated by the Java compiler. It's what makes Java "Write Once, Run Anywhere."

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): A distribution of the JVM and a set of core libraries and other files. It's what you need to run a Java application. It contains the JVM, the Java class libraries, and other supporting files.

JDK (Java Development Kit): A software development environment used for developing Java applications. The JDK includes the JRE, the Java compiler (javac), and other tools like the debugger (jdb), archiver (jar), and documentation generator (javadoc). You need the JDK to compile and develop Java code.

Installation & Configuration (Windows)
Download the JDK: Go to the official Oracle website or an OpenJDK distribution site (like Adoptium) and download the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of the JDK (e.g., JDK 17 or JDK 21) for Windows.

Run the Installer: Run the downloaded installer file (.exe). Follow the on-screen instructions. The installer will typically set up the JDK and JRE on your system.

Set Environment Variables:

Open the Start Menu and search for "Edit the system environment variables."

Click on "Environment Variables..." at the bottom of the window.

In the "System variables" section, click "New..." to create a JAVA_HOME variable. The variable name should be JAVA_HOME and the value should be the path to your JDK installation (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17).

Find the Path variable in the "System variables" section, select it, and click "Edit."

Click "New" and add the path to the JDK's bin directory (e.g., %JAVA_HOME%\bin). Make sure this entry is at the top of the list by moving it up. Click OK.

Verify Installation: Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and run the following command:

java -version

You should see the version of the Java you just installed. If you do, the installation was successful.

Using Eclipse IDE
1. New Project Creation
Launch Eclipse and select your workspace.

Go to File > New > Java Project.

In the new window, give your project a name (e.g., "CCRM-Project").

Make sure the "Use default location" is checked or specify a location for your project.

Under "JRE," select the JDK you installed. The latest version should be automatically detected.

Click Finish.

2. Setting Up Source Files
In the Project Explorer, right-click on your project and select New > Folder. Create a new folder named src.

Right-click on the src folder and select New > Folder. Create a new folder named main.

Right-click on the main folder and select New > Folder. Create a new folder named java.

Finally, right-click on the java folder and select New > Package. Create the edu.ccrm package. Inside this, create the edu.ccrm.domain and edu.ccrm.cli packages to match the provided source code structure.

Drag and drop or copy and paste the provided .java files into their correct packages. Eclipse will automatically recognize them.

3. Running the Application
In the Project Explorer, navigate to edu.ccrm and open the CCRMApplication.java file.

Right-click inside the CCRMApplication.java editor window, and select Run As > Java Application.

The application will compile and execute, and the output will appear in the Eclipse Console at the bottom of the screen.
